I had previously stated that i would not change these add-ons over to the new (2.1) Anki version. That was, mostly, because i could not get the new Anki running. And also because i had lost a bit of interest in the whole endeavour.

The first has changed now, Anki 2.1 seems to work, at least somewhat stable, after i got a Python 3.6 and an up-to-date PyQt version on my system.

The second has also changed a bit. After a few people came around recently to ask about new versions, i think i will spend a bit of time on this again.

Some of the work has already been done by other people, that is [Marcio Mazza](https://github.com/marciomazza). The [download audio]({{ site.github.url }}/Download_audio.html) reportedly works.
