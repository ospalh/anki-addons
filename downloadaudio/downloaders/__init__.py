"""
A list of audio downloaders.

They are intended for use with the Anki2 audiodownload add-on, but can
possibly be used alone. For each downloader in the list, setting its
language variable and then calling download_files(text, base, ruby)
downloads audio files to temp files and fills its downloads_list with
the file names.

When PyQt4 is installed, this downolads the site icon (favicon) for
each site first.
